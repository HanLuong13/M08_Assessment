Group Project - Exploring Census API Data - Annual Business Survey 2019

This project we grabbed data from the Census Bureau about Business Owner, Business Summary, Characteristics of Business Owner, and Technology Characteristics of Businesses. There is an ETL report documenting how to grab all the data using API calls, from the Census Buraeu website. As well as merging all the tables together into one master table.

Each individual's Jupyter Notebook file shows how we decided to answer all the questions we had as a group. Some of these question are about the demographics of businesses and owners by sex, race, gender, ethnicity, and veteran status. In these files, shows how to graph the visuals we have come up with down to the specific columns used to draw our conclusions. All of these conclusions and questions have been documented under the Project Report.docx file.
